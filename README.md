# My Personal NeoVim Setup

Hello, I am proud to share with you my NeoVim setup, which I collected from various sources of the internet and made the most ideal for myself.

You can use, steal, do whatever you want.


# For Setup:

**1 -** First you need to install neovim:

`brew install neovim`

For other installation options: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim

**2 -** Then clone this repo to the **.config** folder inside your root folder (create one if you don't have a .config folder) change the name of a folder to nvim or simply use a command below.

`git clone git@github.com:yemrealtanay/nvim_config.git nvim`

**3 -** Now you can type `nvim` from any folder you want! Wait for updates and good to go...
